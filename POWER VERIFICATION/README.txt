The isperfectpower.py is a code to determine and compute a,b if n is of form a^b and a>1 with time complexity of O(log(n)*â‹…(log(log(n)))**2)
using fast exponentiation and binary search algorithms.

The power.py is a very simple implementation in which a is known quantity and just we need to check if a^x=n.
It has two implementations with first one in O(log n) and the next in O(log(log n)) time and O(log n) space.
